# Direction_of_arrival
This repository has all the files to implement a learning based Direction of Arrival Estimation.

It has files to generate RIR with different microphone postions, room dimensions and source positions with some additional options like type of microphones, reverberation time,etc

The learning based algorithm is CNN based. This audio files used is from LibriSpeech and MUSAN is used to augment it.

Feature extraction and learning code is included with both .m and .ipynb files.
